## Why LumiMail?

We know that email is one of the most essential tools for communication. However, traditional email clients are
often overwhelming with outdated interfaces, confusing options, and unnecessary features. LumiMail is
different – we’ve built it from the ground up with modern users in mind:

- **Platform-Independent**: Whether you're on Linux, macOS, or Windows, LumiMail offers a consistent experience
that integrates seamlessly with your operating system. Linux compatibility is a top priority, ensuring the smoothest
experience for all users, especially those who rely on open-source environments.

- **Unified Inboxes**: Managing multiple email accounts doesn’t have to be a hassle. LumiMail brings all your
inboxes together in a single-screen interface. No need to switch between accounts – everything is right where
you need it.

- **Sleek and Modern Design**: Inspired by Tailwind UI, LumiMail offers a non-cluttered, high-contrast interface
that puts your emails front and center. With its minimalist, intuitive layout, LumiMail is designed
for readability and ease of use, making managing your emails a pleasant experience.

- **Compatibility Without Compromise**: LumiMail supports IMAP and SMTP for all your email needs, along with the
Google Mail API for Gmail users. Whether you use Google, custom domains, or traditional IMAP services,
LumiMail has you covered.

- **Effortless Filtering and Search**: Quickly organize and find your emails with smart filters. Whether it's
filtering by read/unread status, junk, sender, or performing full-text searches, LumiMail makes it easy to stay
on top of your inbox.

- **Rich Text Email Composition**: LumiMail’s rich text editor ensures you can craft beautiful, formatted emails
with ease. It’s powered by [QuillJS](https://quilljs.com/), giving you just the right amount of control
without overwhelming you with too many options.

- **Drafts, Attachments, and More**: Save drafts seamlessly, and handle attachments with ease. While images can be
displayed directly in your emails, other attachments are simple to download and manage.

- **Local Message Caching**: Keep your emails accessible even when offline, with configurable local storage retention.
Whether you're managing emails on the go or offline, LumiMail ensures you're never out of touch with your
communication.

- **Batch Edit with Ease**: Need to mark several emails as read or unread? No problem. LumiMail’s batch editing
feature lets you manage your inbox in bulk with just a few clicks.
